A poor man's Redux (well, it's a container for our application state at least...) is implemented using Context (see [app-state.js](https://github.com/knordkvist/react-todo-hooks-context/blob/master/src/context/app-state.js)).

Implemented using a test-driven approach with Jest and React Testing Library.
